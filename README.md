## About Me
- ðŸ“ƒ Wrote a [paper](https://validark.github.io/DynSDT) on a new data structure that improves upon prefix trees (i.e. tries) to better solve the scored autocomplete problem!
    - Also made a friendly [demo](https://validark.github.io/DynSDT/demo) for it!
- $\Huge \Theta$ Time-complexity enthusiast
    - Did you know that a priority queue implemented as a [1-2-3 Skip list](https://github.com/Validark/1-2-3-Skip-List) can perform the extract-min operation in amortized constant time? (While still maintaining logarithmic insertions!)
- [<sub><sub><img width="22" src="https://roblox-ts.com/img/favicon.ico"></sub></sub>](https://roblox-ts.com) Co-Developed the initial version of [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com) with [@Osyrisrblx](https://github.com/osyrisrblx)
    - Ask me how to parse and transform your complex type in the TypeScript type-language
