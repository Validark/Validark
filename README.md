## About Me
- [ðŸ“ƒ](https://validark.github.io/DynSDT) Wrote a [paper](https://validark.github.io/DynSDT) on my [new data structure](https://github.com/Validark/DynSDT) that improves upon prefix trees (i.e. tries) to better solve the scored autocomplete problem
    - Also made a friendly [demo](https://validark.github.io/DynSDT/demo) for it!
- $\Huge \Theta$ [Big-Theta](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/Books/Everything/html/AnalLower.html) user
    - Did you know that a priority queue implemented as a [1-2-3 Skip list](https://github.com/Validark/1-2-3-Skip-List) can perform the extract-min operation in amortized constant time?
        - And yes, insertions are still logarithmic!
